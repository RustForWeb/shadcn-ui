## 🧪 Test Development

### **Adding New Tests**
1. **Identify the feature** to test
2. **Choose the appropriate test suite** (dynamic-loading or bundle-optimization)
3. **Follow the existing pattern** for test structure
4. **Use descriptive test names** that explain the expected behavior
5. **Include proper assertions** for all important aspects

### **Test Structure Pattern**
```typescript
test.describe('Feature Category', () => {
  test('should perform expected behavior', async ({ page }) => {
    // Arrange: Set up test conditions
    await page.goto('http://127.0.0.1:8080');
    
    // Act: Perform the action being tested
    await page.click('.load-component-btn');
    
    // Assert: Verify the expected outcome
    await expect(page.locator('.component-success')).toBeVisible();
  });
});
```

### **Best Practices**
- **Use descriptive test names** that explain the expected behavior
- **Test one concept per test** for easier debugging
- **Include proper timeouts** for async operations
- **Use page object patterns** for complex selectors
- **Test both positive and negative scenarios**
- **Verify accessibility** in every test

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues**

#### **Server Not Running**
```bash
# Error: "could not find the root package of the target crate"
# Solution: Run from correct directory
cd book-examples/leptos
trunk serve
```

#### **WASM Loading Issues**
```bash
# Error: "WASM bindings not found"
# Solution: Wait for WASM initialization
await page.waitForFunction(() => window.wasmBindings !== undefined);
```

#### **Component Loading Timeouts**
```bash
# Error: "Component loading timeout"
# Solution: Increase timeout for slow operations
await expect(element).toBeVisible({ timeout: 15000 });
```

#### **Playwright Installation Issues**
```bash
# Error: "Playwright not found"
# Solution: Install and setup Playwright
npm install -D @playwright/test
npx playwright install
```

### **Performance Issues**
- **Slow test execution**: Check if development server is responsive
- **Memory issues**: Verify no memory leaks in component loading
- **Timeout errors**: Adjust timeouts for slower environments
